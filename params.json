  "body": "# JRakNet\r\nJRakNet is a networking library for Java which implements the UDP based protocol [RakNet](https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet).\r\nThis library was meant to be used for Minecraft: Pocket Edition servers and clients, but can still be used to create game servers and clients for other video games with ease.\r\n\r\n| Protocol Info             | Version |\r\n| --------------------------|:-------:|\r\n| Current Protocol          | 8       |\r\n| Supported Server Protocol | 8       |\r\n| Supported Client Protocol | 8       |\r\n\r\n# How to create a server\r\nCreating a server in JRakNet is extremely easy, all it takes to create one can be seen right here\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Create server and set listener\r\nRakNetServer server = new RakNetServer(19132, 10, new MCPEIdentifier(\"JRakNet Latency Test\", 91, \"0.16.0\", 0,\r\n\t\t10, System.currentTimeMillis(), \"New World\", \"Survival\"));\r\nserver.setListener(new RakNetServerListener() {\r\n\t// Client connected\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void onClientConnect(RakNetClientSession session) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Client from address \" + session.getAddress() + \" has connected to the server\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Client disconnected\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void onClientDisconnect(RakNetClientSession session, String reason) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Client from address \" + session.getAddress()\r\n\t\t\t\t+ \" has disconnected from the server for the reason \\\"\" + reason + \"\\\"\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Packet received\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void handlePacket(RakNetClientSession session, RakNetPacket packet, int channel) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Client from address \" + session.getAddress() + \" sent packet with ID 0x\"\r\n\t\t\t\t+ Integer.toHexString(packet.getId()).toUpperCase() + \" on channel \" + channel);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Start server\r\nserver.start();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a simple RakNet server that can be tested through Minecraft: Pocket Edition by going to the \"Friends tab\" where the server should show up. Once the server pops up, you should be able to click on it to trigger the connection and packet hooks.\r\n\r\n# How to create a client\r\nCreating a client in JRakNet is also very easy. The code required to create a client can be seen here\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Server address and port\r\nprivate static final String SERVER_ADDRESS = \"sg.lbsg.net\";\r\nprivate static final int SERVER_PORT = 19132;\r\n\r\n// Create client and set listener\r\nRakNetClient client = new RakNetClient();\r\nclient.setListener(new RakNetClientListener() {\r\n\t// Server connected\r\n\tpublic void onConnect(RakNetServerSession session) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Successfully connected to server with address \" + session.getAddress());\r\n\t\tclient.disconnect();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Server disconnected\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void onDisconnect(RakNetServerSession session, String reason) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Sucessfully disconnected from server with address \" + session.getAddress()\r\n\t\t\t+ \" for the reason \\\"\" + reason + \"\\\"\");\r\n\t\tSystem.exit(0);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Connect to server\r\nclient.connect(SERVER_ADDRESS, SERVER_PORT);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA simple RakNet client, this example attempts to connect to the main [LBSG](http://lbsg.net/) server. When it is connected, it closes the connection and shuts down.\r\n\r\n# How to contact\r\nThis project has a twitter page, [@JRakNet](https://twitter.com/JRakNet). There all github commits and releases are tweeted. There is also a G-Mail account, [jraknet@gmail.com](https://gmail.com) for anything related specifically to JRakNet :)\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\nSome DataPacket ID's are reserved by RakNet. Because of this, it is recommended that all game packets not relating to RakNet begin with their own special ID, Minecraft: Pocket Edition does this (It's header byte is currently 0xFE). It is also recommended that game servers and game clients do not use raw packets at all.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n#Contributors\r\n<a href=\"http://marfgamer.net\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LhUiCjL.png\" width=\"135\" height=\"145\"></a> <a href=\"http://github.com/MarfGamer/JRakNet\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oDsb9ze.png\" width=\"135\" height=\"145\" hspace=\"50\"></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet\"><img src=\"http://imgur.com/9p1asD8.png\" width=\"135\" height=\"145\"></a> <a href=\"https://oculus.com\"><img src=\"https://www1.oculus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/oculus_vr_logo_small.png\"></a>\r\n",
